# Plugin Standards Manual

This manual is aimed at providing basic standards and best practices for plugin development.

## 1. Plugin Structure

Each plugin should include two parts:

- Main function (`main_func`): This function implements the main functionality of the plugin. It should accept one argument which is a dictionary containing all the necessary parameters.
- `register` function: This function returns a dictionary describing the plugin, including the plugin's name, description, main function and its parameters.

Example:

```python
def main_func(args):
    # Implementation of the main functionality of the plugin

def register():
    return {
        'name': 'PluginName',
        'description': 'Description of the plugin.',
        'func': main_func,
        'args': [{'name': 'arg1', 'description': 'Description of arg1.'}]
    }
```

## 2. Function Naming

Function naming should follow Python's PEP8 convention. Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores if it consists of multiple words.

## 3. Error Handling

The plugin should gracefully handle all potential errors, this can be achieved by including a try/except block in the main function. If an error is caught, the plugin should print an error message and return a string describing the error.

Example:

```python
def main_func(args):
    try:
        # Implementation of the main functionality of the plugin
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return f"Commands {plugin_name}: Failed. Error: {str(e)}"
```

## 4. Return Values

The main function of the plugin should return a string following the format: `Commands [Plugin Name]: [Success or Failed]. [Returned data or error information]`. Successful returns should include a confirmation message of success, failed returns should include the reason for the failure.

Example:

```python
def main_func(args):
    try:
        # Implementation of the main functionality of the plugin
        return f"Commands {plugin_name}: Success. Data: {result_data}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return f"Commands {plugin_name}: Failed. Error: {str(e)}"
```

## 5. Debugging Information

For ease of debugging, plugins should print information about its run, such as the command executed, returned status codes, etc.

## 6. Dependency Management

If the plugin depends on certain external libraries, these should be imported at the top of the file. If possible, use the Python standard library as much as possible to reduce dependencies.

## 7. Security

Plugins should consider security, for example, they should not execute user-provided commands directly, they should not expose sensitive information without authentication, etc.

Following these standards and best practices will help you create high-quality, maintainable Python plugins.
